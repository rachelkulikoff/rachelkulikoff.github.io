I am a second year PhD student in the [health management and policy](https://sph.umich.edu/hmp/phdstudents/kulikoff-rachel.html) and [political science](https://lsa.umich.edu/polisci/people/graduate-students/-rachel-kulikoff.html) departments at the University of Michigan studying the politics of public health data. Within public health, I study health policy and politics; in political science my subfield is American Politics with a focus on bureaucratic politics. My work also engages with the science and technology studies, specifically, the sociology of quantification. I am a mixed-methods scholar, undertaking both qualitative and quantitative work. 

My dissertation project asks when and why governments produce high-quality data, describing the institutional conditions under which the quality of data produced by the government improves, declines, and remains stable. I argue that data quality improves when expert, autonomous bureaucrats operate in environments of low political contestation. My main empirical case studies are maternal mortality rates, the poverty line, and the consumer price index.  

My research has appeared in *The Lancet*, *The Lancet Regional Health-Americas*, *Health Policy*, and *JAMA Pediatrics*. 

Previously, I worked at Public Health Madison & Dane County on the maternal and child health team and the COVID-19 data team, as an epidemiologist at the Cook County Department of Public Health, and as a modeler at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. I got my MPH in Global Health- Health Metrics at the University of Washington, and my undergraduate degree at the University of Chicago.
