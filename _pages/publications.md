<!-- ## Working Papers

**"Can We Trust Politicized Public Health Data? The Case of COVID-19 in the United States"**

The second Trump administration has caused concerns about the integrity and availability of public health surveillance and data. The COVID-19 pandemic, starting during his first administration, can offer historical answers to questions about data trustworthiness. COVID-19 was both enormously politically salient, and also underwent a quick politicization across party lines in the United States. This paper attempts evaluate the trustworthiness of politicized government data by asking: is there evidence of differential undercounting of COVID-19 deaths by state-level partisanship in the US? It finds that while heterogeneity exists in state-level COVID-19 death undercounting, there is only weak evidence of partisanship driving these differences, and these results are not methodologically or empirically robust. That is, while both Democratic and Republican states undercounted COVID-19 deaths, there is little evidence that states with Republican governors systematically manipulated their COVID-19 data to downplay the pandemic, or that Democratic governors overplayed their success in mitigating the effects of the pandemic. In the polarized political environment of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unlikely that partisanship influenced the quality of COVID-19 data collected and disseminated by state government.
